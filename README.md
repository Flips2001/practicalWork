# Getting Started with this DATA-VISUALISER

## How to use

You can upload some data and this app plots the data on the map for you. You can then let the app cluste you data using DBSCAN and it also proviedes the ability to show rose diagrams. 
To convert the data, use the script provided in the [main.py](https://github.com/Flips2001/practicalWork/blob/main/src/data/main.py) file

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all necessary packages

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This should work because I pushed node_moduls. \
If it does not, delete node_modules and use npm install to reinstall them. You probably have to do this if you are using something different than a mac.
